Fig. 1. South Asian summer monsoon rainfall during active monsoon in 2020. The spatial distributions of mean rainfall (mm day-1) in (a) the observation datasets GPCP and (b) CMORPH, averaged from 11th June to 9th July in 2020. The spatial distributions of mean rainfall difference (mm day-1) between (c) U60km and CMORPH; (d) V4km and U60km; (e) U3km and U60km. The two regions surrounded by red dotted line in a-e indicate the primary rainbelt over the northern India (72.5-92.5oE, 15-25oN) and the secondary rainbelt over the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO; 50-100oE, 0-10oS) respectively. (f) The mean rainfall averaged over two rainbelts in observations and experiments above. The area enclosed by the black solid line in d is in a resolution of ~ 4 km, the area outside the black dotted line is in a resolution of ~ 60 km, and the area between two lines is the transition zone.

Fig. 3. South Asian summer monsoon circulation during active monsoon in 2020. The horizontal wind field (vectors) and speed (color shading) at 850 hPa in (a) the reanalysis ERA5, the experiment (b) U60km and (c) U3km averaged from 11th June to 9th July in 2020. The areas surrounded by the red dotted lines in a-c indicate the region (70-90oE, 15oS-25oN) where the zonal-mean vertical circulation is analyzed. The zonal-mean vertical circulation (with vertical velocity amplified 1000 times, vectors) and vertical velocity (without amplified, color shading) in (d) the reanalysis ERA5, the experiment (e) U60km and (f) U3km, averaged from 11th June to 9th July in 2020.

(a) the frequency of five rainfall intensity levels in CMORPH, GPM, U60km and U3km, counted from 11th June to 9th July in 2020 over the EIO (50-100oE, 0-10oS). (b) The accumulated rainfall of rainfall with different intensities. (c) The column-averaged latent heat released by rainfall with different intensities in U60km and U3km. (d) The contribution (frequency times column-averaged latent heat with the same level) to averaged latent heat by rainfall with different intensities in U60km and U3km.
